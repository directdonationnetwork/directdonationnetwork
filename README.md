# directdonationnetwork
The idea is to build a WhatsApp for donations. It will offer the donor the experience to receive immediately a “Thank you” video from the recipient. The experience will increase the motivation to donate. The donor can see directly the good things that are achieved by the recipient with his donation. The internet allows to shorten the distance and feel compassion for the poor. Donating will be easy like online shopping, a part of life like social media. This could lead to a world where people think: “Do I really need the 10th pair of shoes?“ My friend in a developing country could eat and live from this for two month.”
